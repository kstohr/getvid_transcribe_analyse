# Sample NLP Analysis

This project is a very simple example of how you can use NLP to understand the context of public meetings. I use a sample city council meeting and some basic NLP tools to analyse the transcript of the meeting. Plots include a frequency count of relevant words and a frequency distribution of speakers by speaker throughout the course of the meeting.  

NOTE: For speed and ease, in this instance I used plot.ly to host interactive plots. 

*Plot 1:* Frequency count of relevant words mentionned in sample city council meeting
